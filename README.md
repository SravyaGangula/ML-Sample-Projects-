# ML-Sample-Projects-
I am very interested in machine learning and have chosen to start with this projects in order to become more familiar with the models.
1.MUSHROOM DETECTION:
The goal of this project is to create a machine-learning system that can identify if a particular mushroom is deadly or edible based on characteristics like cap form, cap color, gill color, etc. using several classifiers.
I did this by classifying things using KNN( k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier)

2.CREDIT CARD FRAD DETECTION:

Consumers can become victims of credit card fraud in a number of ways, including when they divulge their credit card information to strangers, when their cards are lost or stolen, when thieves redirect their mail away from the intended recipient and steal it, or when company workers steal a cardholder's cards or credit card numbers. We will create a couple ML models in this notebook using de-identified credit card transaction data. The difficulty in detecting fraud is that it happens far less frequently than authorized transactions.
This research examines credit card fraud and aims to determine if a dataset of transactions contains fraudulent activity or not.I did this by classifying things using LOGESTIC REGRESSION.

3. Advanced Regression Analysis for Housing Prices.
   
This project investigates the Kaggle housing dataset. The dataset has 79 variables that describe different features of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. Training and test sets of the data have been created. Predicting the final Sale Price of the homes in the test data set is the objective.

Missing values in the data set are inferred using sophisticated feature engineering. One hot encoding is used to convert the categorical information into numerical features. Comparisons are made between the results of several regression approaches such Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
